// 1. INTRODUCTION TO EVENT DELEGATION

// Event Delegation is an event handling pattern that allows users to append a Single event listener to a parent element that adds it to all of its present AND future descendants that match a selector.
// Event Deegation is a pattern based upon the concept of Event bubbling.
// By default , events triggered on an element propagate up the DOM tre to the element's parent , its ancestors and on up until the root element(html).
